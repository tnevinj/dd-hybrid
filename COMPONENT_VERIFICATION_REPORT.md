### AI Visual Language
- **Brain Icon**: Primary AI indicator across all assisted mode components
- **Sparkles Icon**: AI insights and enhanced features
- **Zap Icon**: AI automation and efficiency improvements
- **Confidence Levels**: Consistent 85-95% range with percentage display
- **AI Scores**: Standardized X.X/10 format across all modules

### Component Patterns
- **KPI Cards**: Consistent layout with trend indicators, AI insights (assisted mode), and confidence levels
- **Search Filters**: Unified interface with category-based filtering and AI suggestions
- **Recommendation Panels**: Standard format with confidence, impact levels, and actionable buttons
- **Loading States**: Mode-appropriate messaging and consistent visual design

### Data Consistency
- **Mock Data**: Realistic business relationships using seeded generation for consistency
- **Metrics**: Believable KPIs that cross-reference correctly between modules
- **AI Features**: Consistent confidence levels, time savings, and performance improvements
- **Status Vocabulary**: Standardized terminology across all modules

## Key Features Implemented
